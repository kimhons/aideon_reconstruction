# Aideon Tentacle Marketplace - Architecture Design Document

## Overview

The Aideon Tentacle Marketplace will serve as a central hub for distributing, discovering, and integrating third-party tentacles into the Aideon system. This document outlines the architecture, components, and workflows for the marketplace infrastructure.

## Goals and Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Enable third-party developers to create and distribute tentacles
2. Provide Aideon users with a secure way to discover and install tentacles
3. Ensure quality and security of marketplace tentacles
4. Seamlessly integrate with the existing tentacle management system

### Key Requirements
1. **Security**: Robust verification and sandboxing of third-party tentacles
2. **Discoverability**: Search, filtering, and recommendation capabilities
3. **Versioning**: Support for tentacle versioning and updates
4. **Ratings & Reviews**: User feedback system for tentacles
5. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and performance metrics
6. **Developer Tools**: SDK and documentation for tentacle development

## Component Details

### Marketplace Core

#### Registry Service
- Maintains the central repository of all marketplace tentacles
- Handles metadata, versioning, and dependency information
- Provides API for querying and retrieving tentacles

#### Discovery Service
- Implements search and recommendation algorithms
- Manages categorization and tagging of tentacles
- Handles featured and trending tentacles

#### Verification Service
- Performs security scanning of submitted tentacles
- Validates tentacle compliance with marketplace standards
- Manages the approval workflow for new submissions

#### Analytics Service
- Tracks installation and usage metrics
- Provides insights to tentacle developers
- Monitors performance and error rates

### Developer Portal

#### Submission System
- Handles tentacle package uploads
- Manages the submission workflow
- Provides feedback on verification results

#### Documentation Hub
- Hosts comprehensive development guidelines
- Provides API documentation and examples
- Includes tutorials and best practices

#### Developer Dashboard
- Displays performance metrics and user feedback
- Manages tentacle listings and updates
- Handles developer account information

### User Interface

#### Marketplace Browser
- Allows users to discover and explore tentacles
- Displays ratings, reviews, and screenshots
- Provides filtering and sorting options

#### Installation Manager
- Handles the installation process for tentacles
- Manages dependencies and conflicts
- Provides installation status and error reporting

#### Update Manager
- Notifies users of available updates
- Handles the update process
- Manages update preferences and scheduling

### Integration Layer

#### TentacleRegistry Connector
- Integrates with the existing TentacleRegistry
- Handles registration of marketplace tentacles
- Manages tentacle lifecycle within the core system

#### Local Repository Manager
- Maintains a local cache of installed tentacles
- Handles storage and retrieval of tentacle packages
- Manages disk space and cleanup

#### Update Service
- Periodically checks for tentacle updates
- Downloads and prepares updates for installation
- Handles rollback in case of failed updates

## Workflows

### Tentacle Submission Workflow
1. Developer creates a tentacle following marketplace guidelines
2. Developer submits the tentacle package through the Developer Portal
3. Verification Service scans the tentacle for security issues and compliance
4. If approved, the tentacle is added to the Registry Service
5. The tentacle becomes available in the marketplace

### Tentacle Installation Workflow
1. User discovers a tentacle through the Marketplace Browser
2. User initiates installation of the tentacle
3. Installation Manager checks dependencies and conflicts
4. Local Repository Manager downloads and stores the tentacle package
5. TentacleRegistry Connector registers the tentacle with the core system
6. The tentacle is initialized and becomes available for use

### Tentacle Update Workflow
1. Update Service detects a new version of an installed tentacle
2. User is notified of the available update
3. User approves the update installation
4. Update Manager downloads and prepares the update
5. TentacleRegistry Connector unregisters the old version
6. The new version is registered and initialized
7. If the update fails, the system rolls back to the previous version

## Security Considerations

### Tentacle Sandboxing
- All marketplace tentacles run in a restricted sandbox environment
- Limited access to system resources and APIs
- Permission system for accessing sensitive functionality

### Code Verification
- Static analysis of tentacle code for security vulnerabilities
- Dynamic analysis in a controlled environment
- Manual review for high-risk tentacles

### Signing and Verification
- All tentacles must be digitally signed by developers
- Signature verification during installation and updates
- Revocation system for compromised developer accounts

## Integration with Existing System

The Tentacle Marketplace will integrate with the existing tentacle management system through the TentacleRegistry. The integration will:

1. Extend the TentacleRegistry to support marketplace tentacles
2. Add marketplace-specific metadata to tentacle objects
3. Implement versioning and update mechanisms
4. Provide a secure loading mechanism for third-party tentacles

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Implement Registry Service and Local Repository Manager
- Create TentacleRegistry Connector
- Develop basic Marketplace Browser

### Phase 2: Developer Tools
- Implement Submission System
- Create Developer Dashboard
- Develop Documentation Hub

### Phase 3: User Experience
- Enhance Marketplace Browser with search and recommendations
- Implement Installation and Update Managers
- Add ratings and reviews system

### Phase 4: Analytics and Optimization
- Implement Analytics Service
- Add performance monitoring
- Optimize discovery and recommendation algorithms

## Conclusion

The Tentacle Marketplace architecture provides a comprehensive solution for distributing, discovering, and integrating third-party tentacles into the Aideon system. By following this design, we can create a secure, user-friendly marketplace that enhances the extensibility and ecosystem of the Aideon platform.
