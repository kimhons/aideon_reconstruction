# Profit Sharing Model for Aideon Tentacle Marketplace

## Executive Summary

Based on the Developer Platform Tentacle Requirements and industry best practices, we recommend implementing a comprehensive profit sharing model for the Aideon Tentacle Marketplace that balances platform sustainability with developer incentives.

| Silver         | 75%            | 25%            | >1,000 active users or >$10,000 quarterly revenue |
| Gold           | 80%            | 20%            | >10,000 active users or >$50,000 quarterly revenue |
