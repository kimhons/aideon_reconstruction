# Developer Portal Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Developer Portal is a critical component of the Aideon Tentacle Marketplace, providing developers with the tools and resources they need to create, submit, and manage tentacles. This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Developer Portal to meet the 99% confidence interval standard.

## Current State Assessment
After reviewing the existing implementation, we found that the Developer Portal has a solid foundation with the following components:

1. **DeveloperPortalCore.js** - Main entry point with integration for account management, submission system, developer dashboard, development toolkit, and documentation hub
2. **AccountManager.js** - Robust account management with developer vetting, API key generation, and security features
3. **SubmissionSystem.js** - Comprehensive submission management with security checks, verification integration, and publishing workflow

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Account Management System Enhancements

#### Security Enhancements

- Add support for team management and role-based permissions
- Implement developer reputation and trust scoring system
- Add support for developer certification programs

#### API Key Management
- Enhance API key management with scope-based permissions
- Add support for OAuth 2.0 integration
- Implement usage analytics and rate limiting
- Add webhook support for key events

### 2. Submission System Enhancements

#### Tentacle Validation
- Implement comprehensive tentacle validation pipeline
- Add support for automated testing against Aideon core APIs
- Create compatibility checking against different Aideon versions
- Implement dependency analysis and vulnerability scanning

#### Submission Workflow

- Implement version management and update workflows
- Create rollback and hotfix mechanisms

#### Documentation Requirements
- Implement documentation quality checking
- Add support for interactive documentation generation
- Create API reference validation
- Implement example code verification

### 3. Developer Dashboard Enhancements

#### Analytics and Insights
