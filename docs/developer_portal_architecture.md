- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for team-based development
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all developer actions

## Workflow Processes

### 1. Tentacle Development Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Developer creates a new tentacle project
2. **Development**: Developer implements tentacle functionality
3. **Testing**: Developer tests tentacle locally
4. **Submission**: Developer submits tentacle for verification
5. **Verification**: Tentacle undergoes automated and manual verification
6. **Publication**: Verified tentacle is published to the marketplace
7. **Monitoring**: Developer monitors tentacle performance and feedback
8. **Updates**: Developer releases updates and new versions

### 2. Revenue Sharing Process

1. **Pricing Setup**: Developer sets pricing model (free, one-time, subscription)
2. **Revenue Collection**: Marketplace collects payments from users
3. **Revenue Sharing**: Marketplace applies 70/30 revenue sharing model
4. **Payout**: Developer receives their share according to payout schedule
5. **Reporting**: Developer receives detailed financial reports

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Developer Experience

- Developer account management
- Basic submission system
- Simple dashboard with tentacle status

### Phase 2: Enhanced Development Tools

- Tentacle Development SDK
- Templates and code samples
- Documentation hub

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics and Monetization

- Detailed performance analytics
- Revenue tracking and reporting
- User feedback management

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion

- Team collaboration features
- External integrations
- Advanced certification programs

## Technical Architecture

The Developer Portal will be implemented as a set of modular services:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend**: Node.js services with RESTful APIs
- **Storage**: Combination of SQL (user data, transactions) and NoSQL (tentacle metadata, analytics)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Communication**: Event-driven architecture for system integration

## Conclusion

The Developer Portal architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for enabling developers to create, submit, and manage tentacles in the Aideon Marketplace. By focusing on developer experience, robust tooling, and seamless integration with other marketplace components, the Developer Portal will foster a vibrant ecosystem of third-party tentacles that enhance the capabilities of the Aideon platform.
