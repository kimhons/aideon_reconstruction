## 8. Scalability and Resilience Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Tentacles and core services designed to be stateless or manage state externally (e.g., database, cache) to allow horizontal scaling via Kubernetes replicas.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Heavy reliance on HSTIS message bus decouples tentacles and improves resilience.
- **Circuit Breakers & Retries**: Implemented within HSTIS and tentacle clients to handle transient failures.
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes integrated with TRDS health monitoring.
- **Redundancy**: Deployment across multiple availability zones (AWS) or zones (GCP). Cross-cloud redundancy managed by Resilience Tentacle.
- **Graceful Degradation**: System designed to function with reduced capabilities if certain tentacles or external services are unavailable.
- **Resource Management**: Future enhancements for dynamic resource allocation based on load.

## 9. Modularity and Extensibility

- **Standardized Interfaces**: Tentacles interact through well-defined APIs and message formats managed by HSTIS and MCMS.
- **Dependency Injection**: Used internally within tentacles and potentially for core service integration.
- **Capability-Based Discovery**: TRDS allows new tentacles to be added and discovered based on the capabilities they offer.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Features and tentacle integrations can often be enabled/disabled via configuration.
