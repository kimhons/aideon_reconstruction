# Aideon AI Desktop Agent - Specialized Domain Tentacles Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural design for four specialized domain tentacles to complete the Aideon AI Desktop Agent ecosystem:

1. Medical/Health Tentacle
2. Legal Tentacle (with expanded tax/CPA capabilities)
3. Agriculture Tentacle
4. Education Tentacle

Each tentacle follows the established Aideon architectural patterns while addressing domain-specific requirements, compliance standards, and use cases. All tentacles are designed to operate both online and offline, maintaining the hybrid architecture that is core to Aideon's functionality.

## Common Architectural Principles

All specialized domain tentacles adhere to these core principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each tentacle is composed of independent modules that can be updated or replaced without affecting other components.

2. **Hybrid Operation**: All tentacles function in both online and offline modes, with appropriate data synchronization mechanisms.

3. **Compliance-First Architecture**: Security, privacy, and regulatory compliance are built into the architecture, not added as an afterthought.

4. **Integration with Core Systems**: All tentacles integrate with the five core components (HSTIS, MCMS, TRDS, SGF, MIIF) through standardized interfaces.

5. **Scalability**: Architecture supports expansion of capabilities within each domain without requiring fundamental redesign.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Design**: Critical decisions require human oversight and approval, especially in regulated domains.

7. **Explainable AI**: All AI-driven recommendations include explanations of the reasoning process.
