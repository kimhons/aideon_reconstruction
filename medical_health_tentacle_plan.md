# Medical/Health Tentacle Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Medical/Health Tentacle will extend Aideon's capabilities to handle healthcare-related tasks, medical information processing, and health data management with strict compliance to healthcare regulations and privacy standards.

## Core Components

### 1. HIPAA Compliance Manager
- Ensures all data handling complies with HIPAA regulations
- Implements secure storage and transmission of Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Provides audit logging for all PHI access and modifications
- Enforces role-based access controls for medical data

### 2. Medical Knowledge Base
- Integrates with high-accuracy medical models (93.8%+ threshold)
- Provides access to medical terminology, conditions, treatments, and medications
- Implements medical entity recognition and relationship extraction
- Supports both online (API) and offline (embedded) operation modes

### 3. Health Data Processor
- Parses and normalizes health records from various formats (FHIR, HL7, etc.)
- Extracts structured information from unstructured medical texts
- Performs medical image analysis with appropriate models
- Generates health data visualizations and reports

### 4. Clinical Decision Support
- Provides evidence-based recommendations (non-diagnostic)
- Identifies potential medication interactions and contraindications
- Summarizes medical literature and research findings
- Supports medical professionals with relevant information retrieval

### 5. Patient Data Manager
- Securely stores and manages patient health information
- Implements comprehensive encryption for all patient data
- Provides data portability in standard healthcare formats
- Ensures data minimization and purpose limitation

### 6. Medical Document Generator
- Creates medical summaries and reports
- Generates patient education materials
- Produces structured medical documentation
- Supports multiple languages and health literacy levels
