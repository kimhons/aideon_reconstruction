# Aideon AI Desktop Agent

## Project Overview

The Aideon AI Desktop Agent is the world's first general-purpose intelligent desktop agent designed to be fully autonomous and capable of completing all complex tasks that a human user can do on a PC with no supervision. This revolutionary system integrates 24 specialized tentacles and 5 core integration components to create a comprehensive AI solution for desktop environments.

## System Architecture

### Core Integration Architecture

The Aideon AI Desktop Agent is built on a robust core integration architecture consisting of five key components:

1. **Hyper-Scalable Tentacle Integration System (HSTIS)** - A high-performance message bus that enables seamless communication between all tentacles and core components.

2. **Multimodal Context and Messaging System (MCMS)** - Manages context across different modalities, enabling the agent to understand and respond to complex multimodal inputs.

3. **TentacleRegistry and Discovery System (TRDS)** - Provides dynamic discovery and registration of tentacles, allowing for flexible system configuration and extension.

4. **Security and Governance Framework (SGF)** - Ensures secure operation with robust authentication, authorization, and audit capabilities.

5. **Model Integration and Intelligence Framework (MIIF)** - Enables integration with various AI models and provides a unified intelligence layer.

### Tentacle System

The Aideon AI Desktop Agent includes 24 specialized tentacles across multiple categories:

#### Core System Tentacles
