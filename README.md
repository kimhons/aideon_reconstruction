# Aideon AI Desktop Agent

Aideon is a downloadable software for Windows, Mac, and Linux designed to be the first general-purpose desktop agent capable of fully autonomous completion of complex tasks that a human user can perform on a PC with no supervision.

## Project Overview

Aideon is built on a modular hybrid architecture using Tentacles for graceful scale-down based on user PC capabilities. The system is designed to work both with and without internet connectivity, providing a flexible and powerful AI assistant for desktop environments.

## Core Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Tentacle-based component system for extensibility and scalability
- **Offline Capability**: Functions with or without internet connectivity
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Processes and reasons across text, image, audio, and video modalities
- **Decision Intelligence**: Makes informed decisions based on data analysis and evaluation
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Maintains context across different domains and operations
- **DevMaster Capabilities**: World-class software architecture, development, and deployment (admin/invite only)
- **Tentacle Marketplace**: Discover, distribute, and monetize extensions to Aideon's capabilities

## Tentacles

### Multi-Modal Integration Tentacle

The Multi-Modal Integration Tentacle enables seamless processing and reasoning across different modalities including text, images, audio, and video. It serves as the foundation for Aideon's ability to understand and generate multi-modal content.

#### Key Components:

- **Input Pipeline**: Receives and preprocesses multi-modal inputs
- **Processing Core**: Coordinates processing of multi-modal inputs
- **Output Pipeline**: Post-processes and delivers multi-modal outputs
- **Model Registry**: Manages models used for multi-modal processing
- **Modality Handlers**: Specialized components for processing specific modalities
  - Text Handler: Processes text inputs and generates text outputs
  - Image Handler: Processes image inputs and generates image outputs
  - Audio Handler: Processes audio inputs and generates audio outputs
  - Video Handler: Processes video inputs and generates video outputs
- **Cross-Modal Reasoning Engine**: Enables understanding relationships between different modalities
- **Integration Interfaces**: Standardized ways for other tentacles to interact with multi-modal capabilities

#### Key Interfaces:

```javascript
// Process multi-modal input
async function processMultiModalInput(input, options)

// Generate multi-modal output
async function generateMultiModalOutput(spec, context, options)

// Perform cross-modal reasoning
async function performCrossModalReasoning(inputs, query, options)
```

### Decision Intelligence Tentacle

The Decision Intelligence Tentacle enhances Aideon's ability to make informed decisions based on data analysis, option evaluation, and transparent explanations.

#### Key Components:

- **DataAnalyzer**: Processes and analyzes decision-relevant data
- **OptionEvaluator**: Evaluates options based on multiple criteria
- **RecommendationGenerator**: Creates actionable recommendations
- **ExplanationEngine**: Provides transparent explanations for recommendations
- **Advanced ML Models Integration**: Integrates deep learning, reinforcement learning, and NLP
- **Domain-Specific Decision Frameworks**: Specialized frameworks for finance, healthcare, project management, etc.
- **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Supports multi-user decision sessions

### Contextual Intelligence Tentacle

The Contextual Intelligence Tentacle enhances Aideon's ability to understand and maintain context across different domains and operations.

#### Key Components:

- **Context Hierarchy Manager**: Manages nested context structures
- **Temporal Context Tracker**: Tracks how context evolves over time
- **Cross-Domain Context Preserver**: Maintains context across different domains
- **Context-Aware Decision Engine**: Uses context to inform decisions

### DevMaster Tentacle (Admin/Invite Only)

The DevMaster Tentacle transforms Aideon into a world-class software architect, developer, and deployment specialist.

#### Key Components:

- **Code Brain (AI)**: Handles code generation, analysis, and optimization
- **Visual Mind (UI)**: Manages UI/UX design and visualization
- **Deploy Hand (Ops)**: Handles deployment, infrastructure, and operations
- **Collab Interface (Universal)**: Enables collaboration with developers and tools
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Orchestrates the software development lifecycle

### Tentacle Marketplace

The Tentacle Marketplace provides a robust ecosystem for discovering, distributing, and monetizing tentacles.

#### Key Components:

- **MarketplaceCore**: Central management system for the marketplace
- **Developer Portal**: Platform for developers to create and publish tentacles
- **Verification Service**: Ensures security and quality of submitted tentacles
- **Monetization System**: Handles payments, licensing, and revenue sharing (70/30 split)
- **Marketplace UI**: User interface for browsing and installing tentacles
- **User Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive reporting with privacy controls

## System Architecture

Aideon is built on a modular hybrid architecture with the following key systems:

- **Core Event System**: Central event-driven communication
- **Enhanced Configuration System**: Hierarchical configuration with feature flags
- **Metrics Collection System**: Comprehensive metrics for GAIA Score calculation
- **Logging Framework**: Standardized logging across all components
- **Model Service Layer**: Flexible integration of AI models

## GAIA Score System

The GAIA (General AI Aptitude) Score measures Aideon's capabilities across multiple dimensions:

- **Intelligence**: Ability to understand, learn, and solve problems
- **Adaptability**: Ability to adjust to new situations and requirements
- **Autonomy**: Ability to operate independently with minimal supervision
- **Reliability**: Consistency and dependability of operation

Current GAIA Score: 97.0%
