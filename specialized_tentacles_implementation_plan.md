# Aideon AI Desktop Agent - Specialized Domain Tentacles Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for four specialized domain tentacles to complete the Aideon AI Desktop Agent ecosystem:

1. Medical/Health Tentacle
2. Legal Tentacle (with expanded tax/CPA capabilities)
3. Agriculture Tentacle
4. Education Tentacle

The implementation follows Aideon's established development practices, ensuring production-ready code, proper integration with core components, and both online and offline functionality.

## Implementation Approach

All tentacles will be implemented using the following approach:

1. **Phased Development**: Each tentacle will be implemented in phases, with each phase delivering a functional component
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suites will be created before implementation
3. **Continuous Integration**: Regular integration with the core Aideon architecture
4. **Production-Ready Code**: No placeholders or proof-of-concept code
5. **Documentation-First**: API documentation and integration guides created before implementation
6. **Compliance Verification**: Regular compliance checks throughout development

## Common Implementation Requirements

All tentacles must implement:

1. **Standard Tentacle Interface**: Conforming to the HSTIS specification
2. **Context Providers**: For integration with MCMS
3. **Capability Registration**: For discovery through TRDS
4. **Security Controls**: For integration with SGF
5. **Model Integration**: For leveraging AI models through MIIF
6. **Offline Mode**: Functionality that works without internet connectivity
7. **Synchronization**: Data synchronization when connectivity is restored
