# Advanced Error Recovery System Documentation

## Overview

The Advanced Error Recovery system provides sophisticated error detection, diagnosis, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected situations gracefully without user intervention. This system is a critical component for Aideon's autonomous capabilities, enabling it to maintain operation even when encountering errors that would typically require human intervention.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Error Detection**
   - System-level error capture (uncaught exceptions, unhandled rejections)
   - Component-level error reporting
   - Error type registration and categorization
   - Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)

2. **Sophisticated Error Diagnosis**
   - Error pattern analysis and recognition
   - Context-aware error classification
   - Root cause identification
   - Error correlation across components

3. **Intelligent Recovery Strategies**
   - Prioritized recovery strategy execution
   - Multiple recovery attempts with backoff
   - Strategy success/failure tracking
   - Adaptive strategy selection based on history

4. **Robust Event System**
   - Error event subscription mechanism
   - Real-time error notifications
   - Event-driven recovery triggers
   - Safe event emission with listener verification

5. **Comprehensive Logging and Reporting**
   - Detailed error logs with context
   - Recovery attempt history
   - Error pattern reports
   - Integration with metrics collection system

6. **Configuration Integration**
   - Context-aware configuration
   - Dynamic recovery behavior adjustment
   - Environment-specific error handling
   - User notification preferences

## Usage Examples

### Registering Error Types

```javascript
// Register a custom error type
errorManager.registerErrorType('database.connection.failed', {
  description: 'Database connection failure',
  severity: 'high'
});
```

### Registering Recovery Strategies

```javascript
// Register a recovery strategy for database connection failures
errorManager.registerRecoveryStrategy('database.connection.failed', {
  name: 'reconnect.strategy',
  description: 'Attempts to reconnect to the database',
  action: async (error) => {
    // Reconnection logic here
    return { success: true, data: 'Reconnected successfully' };
  },
  priority: 10
});
```

### Handling Errors

```javascript
// Handle an error
await errorManager.handleError({
  error: new Error('Failed to connect to database'),
  type: 'database.connection.failed',
  component: 'database.service',
  context: {
    connectionString: 'masked-for-security',
    attemptCount: 3
  }
});
```

### Subscribing to Error Events

```javascript
// Subscribe to error events
const unsubscribe = errorManager.subscribeToErrors((errorEvent) => {
  console.log(`Error occurred: ${errorEvent.error.message}`);
  
  // Take action based on error type
  if (errorEvent.type === 'database.connection.failed') {
    // Custom handling logic
  }
});

// Later, unsubscribe when no longer needed
unsubscribe();
```

## Integration with Other Systems

The Advanced Error Recovery system integrates with:

1. **Metrics Collection System** - Records error occurrences, recovery attempts, and success rates
2. **Configuration System** - Adapts recovery behavior based on context and environment
3. **Logging System** - Provides detailed error logs for analysis and debugging
4. **Notification System** - Alerts users about critical errors when necessary

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead during normal operation
- Efficient error handling with asynchronous recovery
- Optimized event emission with listener verification
- Configurable logging levels to control disk usage

## Security Considerations

- Error logs sanitize sensitive information
- Error events include only necessary context
- Recovery strategies operate with principle of least privilege
- Error reporting respects user privacy settings

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based error prediction
- Automated recovery strategy generation
- Cross-system error correlation
- Enhanced visualization of error patterns
