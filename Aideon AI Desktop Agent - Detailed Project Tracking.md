# Aideon AI Desktop Agent - Detailed Project Tracking

## Project Overview
Aideon is a downloadable software for Windows, Mac, and Linux designed to be the first general-purpose desktop agent capable of fully autonomous completion of complex tasks that a human user can perform on a PC with no supervision.

## Implementation Details

### DevMaster Tentacle

#### Overview
The DevMaster Tentacle transforms Aideon into a world-class software architect, developer, and deployment specialist. This tentacle is only available to admin users and those with special invite codes.

#### Architecture
The DevMaster Tentacle follows a modular architecture with five main components:

1. **Code Brain (AI)** - Handles code generation, analysis, and optimization
2. **Visual Mind (UI)** - Manages UI/UX design and visualization
3. **Deploy Hand (Ops)** - Handles deployment, infrastructure, and operations
4. **Collab Interface (Universal)** - Enables collaboration with developers and tools
5. **Lifecycle Manager** - Orchestrates the software development lifecycle

#### Key Features
- **Admin/Invite-Only Access** - Restricted to administrators and users with valid invite codes
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - All components communicate through a central event system
- **Metrics Integration** - Comprehensive metrics collection for GAIA Score calculation
- **Configuration Integration** - Uses the Enhanced Configuration System for all settings
- **API-First Design** - All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs

#### Implementation Status
- Core architecture and all major components implemented
- Access control system with admin and invite code functionality complete
- Integration with Aideon core systems (events, metrics, configuration) complete
- API endpoints registered for all functionality
- Pending: comprehensive test suite, example projects, and user documentation

#### GAIA Score Impact
The DevMaster Tentacle is expected to improve Aideon's GAIA Score by +1.5-2.0% through:
- Enhanced Intelligence: +0.6-0.8%
- Improved Adaptability: +0.5-0.7%
- Better User Experience: +0.4-0.5%

### Contextual Intelligence Tentacle

#### Overview
The Contextual Intelligence Tentacle enhances Aideon's ability to understand and maintain context across different domains and operations.

#### Architecture
The tentacle is designed with four main components:

1. **Context Hierarchy Manager** - Manages nested context structures
2. **Temporal Context Tracker** - Tracks how context evolves over time
3. **Cross-Domain Context Preserver** - Maintains context across different domains
4. **Context-Aware Decision Engine** - Uses context to inform decisions

#### Implementation Status
- Architecture design complete
- Implementation pending

#### Expected GAIA Score Impact: +1.0-1.3%

## Next Steps
1. Complete the DevMaster Tentacle test suite and documentation
2. Implement the Contextual Intelligence Tentacle
3. Develop the Decision Intelligence Tentacle
4. Build the Multi-Modal Integration Tentacle
5. Address minor gaps in the Enhanced Configuration System

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- Schema migration tools in Enhanced Configuration System need enhancement
- Configuration history browsing capabilities are limited
- Cross-property validation in configuration system needs improvement
- Documentation generation could be more comprehensive

## Project Timeline
- Enhanced Configuration System: Completed
- DevMaster Tentacle: Core implementation completed, testing and documentation in progress
- Contextual Intelligence Tentacle: Architecture designed, implementation pending
- Decision Intelligence Tentacle: Planning phase
- Multi-Modal Integration Tentacle: Planning phase
- Target GAIA Score of 99%+: Expected by completion of all planned tentacles

## Notes
- All code is maintained in GitHub repositories:
  - https://github.com/AllienNova/aideon-ai-desktop-agent
  - https://github.com/kimhons/aideon_reconstruction
- The Enhanced Configuration System and DevMaster Tentacle are implemented in the feature branches
- Pull requests will be created to merge these features into the main branch once testing is complete
