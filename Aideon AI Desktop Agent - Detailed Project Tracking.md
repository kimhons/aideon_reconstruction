## Critical Architectural Patterns

### Cross-Tentacle Communication
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Standardized event interface for all tentacles
2. **Component Registration**: Centralized registry for all system components
3. **Request-Response Pattern**: Standardized request handling across tentacles
4. **Domain-Based Broadcasting**: Efficient communication to groups of related tentacles
5. **Communication Chains**: Multi-tentacle workflows with context preservation

### Dynamic Tentacle Growth
1. **Factory Function Pattern**: All tentacles use factory functions instead of classes to ensure method preservation
2. **Direct Object Pattern**: Methods are defined as direct properties, not on prototype chains
3. **Module Boundary Adapters**: Adapters ensure reliable cross-component communication
4. **Capability-Based Design**: Tentacles expose capabilities that other tentacles can discover
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Standardized tentacle initialization, activation, and shutdown
