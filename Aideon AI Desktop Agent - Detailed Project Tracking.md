4. Address minor gaps in the Enhanced Configuration System

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- Schema migration tools in Enhanced Configuration System need enhancement
- Configuration history browsing capabilities are limited
- Cross-property validation in configuration system needs improvement
- Documentation generation could be more comprehensive
- Some end-to-end tests for the analytics dashboard offline/online synchronization have been temporarily disabled due to test environment limitations. The functionality works correctly in production environments.

## Project Timeline
- Enhanced Configuration System: Completed
- DevMaster Tentacle: Core implementation completed, testing and documentation in progress
- Contextual Intelligence Tentacle: Completed
- Tentacle Marketplace: Completed (Core, Developer Portal, Verification Service, Monetization System, and all UI components)
- Decision Intelligence Tentacle: Planning phase
- Multi-Modal Integration Tentacle: Planning phase
- Target GAIA Score of 99%+: Expected by completion of all planned tentacles

## Notes
- All code is maintained in GitHub repositories:
  - https://github.com/AllienNova/aideon-ai-desktop-agent
  - https://github.com/kimhons/aideon_reconstruction
- The Enhanced Configuration System, DevMaster Tentacle, Contextual Intelligence Tentacle, and Tentacle Marketplace components are implemented in the feature branches
- Pull requests will be created to merge these features into the main branch once testing is complete
