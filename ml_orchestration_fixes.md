# ML Model Orchestration Fixes

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented for the ML model orchestration system in Aideon Core, specifically addressing issues with concurrent task handling and auto-unloading of models.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Concurrent Task Handling
**Problem**: The original implementation did not properly handle concurrent requests for the same model, leading to potential race conditions where multiple threads would attempt to load the same model simultaneously.

**Solution**: Implemented a lock-based mechanism using promises to ensure that when multiple requests for the same model arrive concurrently, only one loading operation is performed while other requests wait for its completion.

```javascript
// Check if model is currently being loaded by another request
if (this.modelLoadLocks.has(modelId)) {
  logger.debug(`Model ${modelId} is already being loaded, waiting for completion`);
  
  // Wait for the existing load operation to complete
  return await this.modelLoadLocks.get(modelId);
}

// Create a promise for this load operation
let resolveLoadPromise, rejectLoadPromise;
const loadPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolveLoadPromise = resolve;
  rejectLoadPromise = reject;
});

// Set the load lock
this.modelLoadLocks.set(modelId, loadPromise);
```

### 2. Auto-Unloading Issues
**Problem**: The auto-unloading mechanism did not properly check for active tasks using a model, potentially unloading models that were still in use.

**Solution**: Implemented a task tracking system that maintains a count of active tasks per model, preventing unloading of models with active tasks.

```javascript
// Skip models with active tasks
const activeTasks = this.activeModelTasks.get(model.id) || 0;
if (activeTasks > 0) {
  logger.debug(`Skipping unload of model ${model.id} with ${activeTasks} active tasks`);
  continue;
}
```

### 3. Periodic Checking
**Problem**: The original implementation relied solely on timers set during model usage, which could lead to memory leaks if timers were not properly cleared.

**Solution**: Added a periodic checker that runs at regular intervals to identify and unload unused models, providing a more robust cleanup mechanism.

```javascript
startAutoUnloadChecker() {
  // Check for unused models every minute
  const checkInterval = Math.min(60000, this.options.autoUnloadTimeout / 2);
  
  this.autoUnloadCheckerId = setInterval(() => {
    this.checkAndUnloadUnusedModels()
      .catch(error => {
        logger.error(`Error in auto-unload checker: ${error.message}`, error);
      });
  }, checkInterval);
  
  logger.debug(`Auto-unload checker started with interval ${checkInterval}ms`);
}
```

### 4. Task Lifecycle Management
**Problem**: The system lacked explicit methods for tracking the beginning and end of tasks using models.

**Solution**: Added `beginModelTask` and `endModelTask` methods to explicitly track when models are being used for tasks.

```javascript
beginModelTask(modelId, taskId) {
  if (!modelId || !taskId) {
    return false;
  }
  
  logger.debug(`Beginning task ${taskId} with model ${modelId}`);
  
  // Record model usage
  this.recordModelUsage(modelId);
  
  // Increment active task count
  const activeTasks = this.activeModelTasks.get(modelId) || 0;
  this.activeModelTasks.set(modelId, activeTasks + 1);
  
  return true;
}

endModelTask(modelId, taskId) {
  if (!modelId || !taskId) {
    return false;
  }
  
  logger.debug(`Ending task ${taskId} with model ${modelId}`);
  
  // Decrement active task count
  const activeTasks = this.activeModelTasks.get(modelId) || 0;
  
  if (activeTasks > 0) {
    this.activeModelTasks.set(modelId, activeTasks - 1);
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### 5. Model Selection Optimization
**Problem**: The model selection algorithm did not prioritize already-loaded models, potentially leading to unnecessary model loading/unloading operations.

**Solution**: Enhanced the model selection algorithm to prioritize models that are already loaded, reducing resource usage and latency.

```javascript
// Prioritize models that are already loaded
const loadedModels = await this.modelRegistry.getLoadedModels();
const loadedModelIds = new Set(loadedModels.map(m => m.id));

candidateModels.sort((a, b) => {
  // First sort by loaded status
  const aLoaded = loadedModelIds.has(a.modelId) ? 0 : 1;
  const bLoaded = loadedModelIds.has(b.modelId) ? 0 : 1;
  
  if (aLoaded !== bLoaded) {
    return aLoaded - bLoaded;
  }
  
  // Then by priority
  return (a.priority || 0) - (b.priority || 0);
});
```

## Testing Results
The fixes have been tested with concurrent model requests and have shown significant improvements:

- Eliminated race conditions during concurrent model loading
- Prevented premature unloading of models in active use
- Reduced unnecessary model loading/unloading operations
- Improved resource utilization and reduced memory leaks
- Enhanced overall stability of the model orchestration system

## Next Steps
1. Update the GitHub repository with these changes
2. Implement additional API connectors for Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and Cohere
3. Begin implementation of specialized domain tentacles
